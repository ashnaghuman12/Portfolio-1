  <h2>Bio:</h2>
  <h3>My name is Ashna but my close friends and family call me Ash or Ashy. I've lived in the Bay Area for over 12 years. This August, I'll be turing 16 and going into Junior year. One of my favorite things to do is hang out with my family and friends. Some of my hobbies include playing sports, art, and film, although lately I’ve been into coding.</h3>

  <h4>Dislikes: I strongly dislike theatre. I think that it's boring and movies are a lot more interesing.</h4>

  <h5>Likes: One of my favorite things to do is ASL. During my free time or whenever I listen to music, I always try signing along to the lyrics. Most of my friends are fluent in it so a lot of the time we just sign instead of talking.</h5>
